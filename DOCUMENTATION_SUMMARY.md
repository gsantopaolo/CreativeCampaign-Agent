### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending: notes.md

**Unable to update notes.md automatically** (file edit conflicts). 

**Please manually add** the presentation structure to `notes.md`:

```markdown
## Presentation Structure (30 minutes)

### 5 min: Business Requirements Mapping
- Challenge overview: Pain points of manual creative production at scale
- Our solution mapping
- Requirements traceability matrix

### 8 min: Architecture Deep-dive
- WHY microservices? (Scale, fault isolation, team velocity, cost)
- WHEN to simplify? (Low volume, single team, prototype)
- HOW we leverage proven patterns (70% from Sentinel-AI, agentic self-evaluation)

### 5 min: Live Demo (with backup recording)
1. Brief submission (2 products, 3 locales)
2. Watch NATS dashboard (events flowing)
3. Show generated creatives (Raw ‚Üí Branded ‚Üí Final)
4. Approval/revision workflow
5. Observability (logs, metrics, correlation IDs)

### 7 min: Production Considerations
**Scaling**: K8s HPA, GPU nodes, regional deployment
**Cost**: On-demand vs reserved, API quotas, S3 lifecycle
**Security**: Secret managers, RBAC, encryption, network policies
**Monitoring**: Metrics, logs, traces, alerts

### 5 min: Q&A + "Simplified Path" Discussion
- Address "over-engineered" concerns
- Show docs/simplified-alternative.md
- Discuss trade-offs: monolith vs microservices vs hybrid
```

## Architecture Decisions Summary

### Simplified from Original Design

| Component | Original | New Approach | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Orchestration** | Separate orchestration-router service | Embedded in api-gateway | Simpler for POC volume |
| **Scoring/Selection** | Separate scorer-selector service | Agentic self-evaluation in generators | Modern pattern, fewer services |
| **Compliance** | Separate compliance-checker service | Built into agentic generators | Compliance as a gate, not separate step |
| **Approval Handler** | Separate approval-handler service | Part of api-gateway + image-generator agentic | Revision logic where it belongs |

### Final Service Count: 6 Core + 2 Supporting

**Core Services:**
1. **api-gateway** - REST API + orchestration logic
2. **context-enricher** - Locale-specific context packs
3. **image-generator** - CrewAI agentic (generate ‚Üí evaluate ‚Üí comply)
4. **brand-composer** - Logo/color overlay
5. **copy-generator** - CrewAI agentic localized copy
6. **overlay-composer** - Text rendering + multi-aspect export

**Supporting:**
7. **guardian-dlq** - Failure monitoring
8. **ui-webapp** - Streamlit UI

## Key Messages for Presentation

### 1. Production Thinking
"This isn't a toy demo. This is how we'd deploy for an Adobe customer in 2 days."

### 2. Leverage Experience
"70% of infrastructure code reused from Sentinel-AI. Focus effort on business logic, not rebuilding NATS integration."

### 3. Architectural Judgment
"I know when to simplify (see simplified-alternative.md) and when to scale (this design). Choice depends on context."

### 4. Modern Patterns
"Agentic self-evaluation with CrewAI eliminates 6 traditional services. Better quality through self-critique."

### 5. Right-Sized Design
"Not 20 services, not 1 service. 6 core services is the sweet spot for this use case."

## How to Use These Docs in Interview

### Before Presentation
1. ‚úÖ Review all docs (especially why-microservices.md)
2. ‚úÖ Practice explaining agentic self-evaluation
3. ‚úÖ Be ready to show simplified-alternative.md
4. ‚úÖ Know the reuse percentages (70% from Sentinel-AI)

### During Presentation
**If asked: "Is this over-engineered?"**
- Response: "For Adobe customer scale, this is right-sized. I can also show a 300-line monolithic version (open simplified-alternative.md)"

**If asked: "Did you build this from scratch?"**
- Response: "No, I leveraged proven patterns from Sentinel-AI. This is how senior engineers work‚Äî25 hours saved on infrastructure (open reused-patterns.md)"

**If asked: "Can you explain the architecture?"**
- Response: "6 core services + 2 supporting. Simplified from 14 using agentic self-evaluation (open architecture.md, show diagram)"

### After Presentation (Q&A)
**Question**: "Why microservices for a POC?"
- Answer: "Demonstrates production thinking. Adobe customers need scale. But I understand trade-offs (show why-microservices.md comparison table)"

**Question**: "How do you know these patterns work?"
- Answer: "Sentinel-AI runs in production. These are battle-tested patterns, not experimental."

**Question**: "What if we only had 50 campaigns/month?"
- Answer: "Start with the monolithic version (simplified-alternative.md). Extract services when scale demands it."

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Review all new docs** - Make sure you understand the content
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manually update notes.md** - Add presentation structure (copy from above)
3. üî® **Start implementation** - Begin with core services
4. üìä **Create presentation deck** - Use these docs as outline
5. üé• **Record demo** - Show the system working

## Questions to Clarify Before Implementation

### 1. Agentic Framework
- **Confirmed: CrewAI** for image-generator and copy-generator

### 2. Image Generation Provider
- **Options**: OpenAI DALL-E 3, Replicate (SDXL), Stability AI, Together.ai
- **Recommendation**: Replicate for flexibility + OpenAI as backup

### 3. Observability Level
- **Option A**: Full stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki) - shows enterprise thinking
- **Option B**: Simplified (structured logging + NATS dashboard) - faster to implement
- **Recommendation**: Option B for POC, mention Option A in docs

### 4. Context Enricher Approach
- **Hybrid**: Static YAML templates + optional LLM enhancement
- Faster than pure LLM, smarter than pure static

### 5. Compliance Policy
- **Warn-only**: Flag issues but allow override in UI
- Production-like but POC-friendly
