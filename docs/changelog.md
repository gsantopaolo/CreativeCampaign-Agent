### Changed

#### 🎨 Brand Composition Workflow
- **Before**: Manual logo_position selection (top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right)
- **After**: AI analyzes each image and determines optimal placement with reasoning

#### 📊 MongoDB Schema
**branded_images collection** - Added fields:
```json
{
  "logo_placement_reasoning": "AI explanation of placement choice",
  "logo_scale": 0.15
}
```

#### 🌐 API Schema
**Campaign Creation** - Removed from `placement` object:
```json
{
  "placement": {
    "logo_position": "bottom_right"  // ❌ REMOVED
  }
}
```

#### 🖥️ Web UI
- Logo position selector replaced with AI info box
- Branded images now display AI reasoning
- Default logo preview added
- Banned words pre-filled with industry defaults

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies Added
- `openai>=1.12.0` (Brand Composer)
- `boto3==1.34.34` (already present, now used in test_api.py)

#### Environment Variables Added
- `S3_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT_URL` - External MinIO endpoint for browser-accessible presigned URLs
- `OPENAI_TEXT_MODEL` - Model for vision analysis (default: gpt-4o-mini)

#### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /campaigns/{campaign_id}/branded-images` - Retrieve branded images with AI metadata

### Performance Impact

- **AI Analysis Time**: ~3-8 seconds per image
- **Total Branding Time**: ~5-10 seconds per image (including download, AI analysis, processing, upload)
- **Cost**: ~$0.00015 per image (GPT-4o-mini vision)

### Migration Notes

#### For Existing Campaigns
- Old campaigns with manual `logo_position` will continue to work
- New campaigns automatically use AI-powered placement
- No database migration required

#### For API Consumers
- `logo_position` field in campaign creation is now **ignored** (optional for backward compatibility)
- Branded images now include `logo_placement_reasoning` and `logo_scale` fields
- Presigned URLs now use external endpoint for browser accessibility

### Testing

#### Automated Tests
- `test_api.py` updated to test logo upload and AI-powered branding
- Run with: `python src/api/test_api.py`

#### Manual Testing
1. Create campaign via web UI or API
2. Check brand-composer logs for AI analysis output
3. View branded images in web UI
4. Verify AI reasoning is displayed

### Compliance

This feature aligns with CHALLENGE.md requirements:
- ✅ **Brand compliance checks** - Logo presence and optimal placement
- ✅ **Thoughtful design choices** - AI-driven intelligent automation
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Fallback strategies, logging, monitoring

### Known Limitations

1. **Logo Watermark**: Currently uses text "BRAND" instead of actual logo image
   - Future: Download and composite actual logo from S3
2. **Single Logo**: Only supports one logo per campaign
   - Future: Multi-logo support with separate analysis
3. **No Custom Constraints**: Cannot specify "no-go zones"
   - Future: Allow campaigns to define restricted areas

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback by:
1. Revert to previous docker images
2. Re-enable manual `logo_position` in web UI
3. Update brand-composer to skip AI analysis

### Contributors

- AI-powered logo placement implementation
- S3 presigned URL fixes
- Web UI enhancements
- Documentation updates
